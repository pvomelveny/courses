# Fast.AI Notebooks 

Following along with [fast.ai's MOOC](http://course.fast.ai/index.html) "Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Part 1".

The repo is a fork of the fast.ai one. They provide notebooks and setup scripts, but, as per their advice, I'm going to reimplement most of actual code on my own. This is where I'll stash my own personal notebooks.
